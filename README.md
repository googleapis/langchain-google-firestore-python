* [API Reference]()

## Getting Started

In order to use this library, you first need to go through the following steps:

1. [Select or create a Cloud Platform project.][project]
2. [Enable billing for your project.][billing]
3. [Enable the Google Cloud Firestore API.][api]
4. [Setup Authentication.][auth]

### Installation

Install this library in a [`virtualenv`][venv] using pip. [`virtualenv`][venv] is a tool to
create isolated Python environments. The basic problem it addresses is one of
dependencies and versions, and indirectly permissions.

With [`virtualenv`][venv], it's possible to install this library without needing system
install permissions, and without clashing with the installed system
dependencies.

```bash
pip install virtualenv
virtualenv <your-env>
source <your-env>/bin/activate
<your-env>/bin/pip install langchain-google-firestore
```

## Document Loader Usage

Use a document loader to load data as LangChain `Document`s.

```python
from langchain_google_firestore import FirestoreLoader


loader = FirestoreLoader("Collection")
docs = loader.lazy_load()
```

See the full [Document Loader][loader] tutorial.

## Chat Message History Usage

Use `ChatMessageHistory` to store messages and provide conversation history to LLMs.

```python
from langchain_google_firestore import FirestoreChatMessageHistory


history = FirestoreChatMessageHistory(
    session_id="my-session-id",
    collection="HistoryMessages"
)
```

See the full [Chat Message History][history] tutorial.
